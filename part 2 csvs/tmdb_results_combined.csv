The capital to start with they want to get from grandpa, who has come home from America with a suitcase full of money. Everybody wants Mesi to approach the old man, because she is the only one he would speak to. But Mesi is more concerned with the idea that she wants a child, by now from anyone, while Pepe is jealous. Kapa’s alleged son emerges, with the mafia behind him: they, too, are eager to get grandpa’s money. After threats and blackmailing, poisoned apples are sent, with only one side of them poisonous. Those dead, by the way, are resurrected by the sound of a song. At last, nobody manages to get the money, but it wouldn’t make sense anyway: it’s all fake.

Watson falls in love with the car, but real life quickly catches up to her in the form of the repo man when she falls behind on her monthly payments. To avoid losing her beloved wheels, Watson tries her hand at two of the oldest professions: waiting tables and phone sex. At the same time, her meddling best friend (Jamie Harrold), convinces Watson to ignite her stagnant love life by pursuing a sexually-phobic pilot (Gabriel Macht) and an aloof supermarket cashier (Glenn Fitzgerald).

Aroldo (Pedro Lander) breaks into Gallego's safe and steals his gold, along with a good deal of gold that Gallego was holding for his workers.

With no where else to turn, Sven asks Falk to help him deal with the crazed Lehmann; Falk agrees, but soon realizes he's dealing with a more dangerous man than he imagined when Lehmann kidnaps Falk's wife Jeanette, and then releases her with a time bomb locked around her neck, demanding that Falk hand over ownership of his detective agency to Lehmann.",3.407,/8vS6T2XkXDuYqpyKec2lz2Jocw9.jpg,"[{'id': 2801, 'logo_path': '/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png', 'name': 'Film i Väst', 'origin_country': 'SE'}, {'id': 57354, 'logo_path': '/8CrMUkfg01tmrNbWxq0s6v0Dg6m.png', 'name': 'TV3 Sverige', 'origin_country': 'SE'}, {'id': 1929, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Sonet Film', 'origin_country': 'SE'}, {'id': 447, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'TV 1000 Sverige', 'origin_country': 'SE'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'SE', 'name': 'Sweden'}]",2001-08-17,0.0,112.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'english_name': 'Estonian', 'iso_639_1': 'et', 'name': 'Eesti'}, {'english_name': 'Swedish', 'iso_639_1': 'sv', 'name': 'svenska'}, {'english_name': 'German', 'iso_639_1': 'de', 'name': 'Deutsch'}]",Released,,Executive Protection,0.0,6.1,40.0,

Though wary, Helene agrees to help, and soon the couple is 40,000 francs richer -- and on the run from the law. The two hop a train to Marseilles, but it isn't long before Helene begins to think the robbery was a bad idea -- and isn't certain if her relationship with Paul is such a good thing either. Paul, however, isn't troubled by any second thoughts, and is very certain about his feelings for Helene -- so much so that he forces a priest to marry them at gunpoint. This is only the most recent manifestation of Paul's volatile personality, and rather than binding Helene closer to him, it only drives her farther away.",1.4,,[],[],2001-06-06,0.0,92.0,"[{'english_name': 'French', 'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'Français'}]",Released,,Bandits d'amour,0.0,0.0,0.0,
