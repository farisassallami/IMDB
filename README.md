 ### Business Problem

The business problem in this project was to identify the factors that contribute to a movie's success and to provide recommendations to stakeholders on how to make a successful movie. To achieve this, we needed to analyze various movie-related factors, including box office revenue, budget, genre, director, and cast. By performing exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing, we aimed to identify the factors that have a significant impact on a movie's success.

### Project Description

The goal of this project was to produce a MySQL database on movies using a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. The objective was to analyze what makes a movie successful and provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.

### Procedure

Over the course of the project, I completed the following tasks:

1. Downloaded several files from IMDB's movie data set and filtered out the subset of movies requested by the stakeholder.
2. Used an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to the IMDB data and performed exploratory data analysis.
3. Constructed and exported a MySQL database using the data.
4. Applied hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.

### Which movie rating earns the most revenue?

PG Earns the Most revenue on average followed by PG-13.  This Indicates that movies geared toward younger audience gross more revenue on average.

We can see that on average Long Movies (150 minutes and more) tend to gross more revenue than short movies (90 minutes or less).

#### Which budget class grossed more on average?

As we can see, higher level budget films ($100 Million or more) on average grossed the most revenue.  Followed by Mid Budget ( $10 Million - $100Million), and lastly Low budget ($10 Million or less).

### Recommendations 

Attract funding for large scale budget films.  Focus on childrens movies and pre-teens and make sure they are more than 90 minutes long.
I am confident that the insights derived from this analysis will be useful to the stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding the production of successful movies in the future.
