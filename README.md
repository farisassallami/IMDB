 ### Business Problem

The business problem in this project was to identify the factors that contribute to a movie's success and to provide recommendations to stakeholders on how to make a successful movie. To achieve this, we needed to analyze various movie-related factors, including box office revenue, budget, genre, director, and cast. By performing exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing, we aimed to identify the factors that have a significant impact on a movie's success.

### Project Description

The goal of this project was to produce a MySQL database on movies using a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. The objective was to analyze what makes a movie successful and provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.

### Procedure

Over the course of the project, I completed the following tasks:

1. Downloaded several files from IMDB's movie data set and filtered out the subset of movies requested by the stakeholder.
2. Used an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to the IMDB data and performed exploratory data analysis.
3. Constructed and exported a MySQL database using the data.
4. Applied hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this project was a great opportunity to work on a real-world business problem and apply data analysis techniques to derive insights from data. By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in data extraction, data analysis, hypothesis testing, and database construction. I am confident that the insights derived from this project will be useful to the stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding the production of successful movies in the future.
